nscale release policy
=====================

This documents present the release policy for the nscale deployer.

__nscale__ is a young project and it is going through __fast iterations__:
we are currently in versions 0.x and it will stay in 0.x
up until it is needed. We will update this document in a timely fashion.

We __plan to release updates on a weekly basis__, and use github issues
to track the process.

Semantic Versioning
-------------------

In the nscale deployer we follow the [semantic
versioning](http://semver.org/), which means that:

([quoted](http://semver.org/)) Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

  * MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  * MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  * PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

nscale is currently on version 0.x: this means we might change the API and the
commands as needed to evolve the project. If you are worried about backward compatibility,
get in touch via email at nscale@nearform.com. We can support you through the
various updates and provide professional suport.

Current development phase
-------------------------

In the current development phase, we will use PATCH versions for
bugfixes and MINOR versions for new features.

Changelog and releases
----------------------

We commit to maintain
https://github.com/nearform/nscale/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md update with
each release change.
